 NOBSSQL.ps1  -  local web-based MySQL/MariaDB client
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 A tiny PowerShell HTTP server (127.0.0.1 only, no admin) that shells out to
 mysql.exe / mysqldump.exe and returns JSON; the UI is a self-contained HTML
 page in your default browser.

 Features: browse schemas + objects (tables/views/routines/triggers/events),
 run SQL in tabs, editable result grids (insert/update/delete), view & edit
 object DDL, create/drop schemas, drop/rename/truncate tables, data export and
 import.

 USAGE:  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\NOBSSQL.ps1
         (browser opens automatically; close THIS console to stop the server)

# Api-DownloadTools extracts the .exe files into a flat directory with no lib/plugin beside them,
# so the bundled client had nowhere to find it and every connection to a stock MySQL 8 server died
# before it could even ask for SSL:

#   The specified module could not be found. Library path is 'caching_sha2_password.dll'
#
# The plugins ship in the same archive the binaries come from; they were simply not being unpacked.
# They are now, into a plugin/ directory beside them, and this points the client at it.
#
# Only for OUR copy. A client from a real MariaDB or MySQL installation sits in a proper bin/ with

# ============================================================================
#  STREAMING QUERY CURSORS (large-result-set editor queries)
#  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Run-Query2 above (and Run-Query2Bulk below) read the ENTIRE mysql.exe stdout
#  via ReadToEndAsync() before parsing a single row - fine for the DDL/PK/FK/
#  compare-support queries they're used for, but a real crash risk for an
#  editor query against a large table: a high/missing LIMIT fully materializes
#  the whole result set as one giant .NET string before any of it is returned.
#
#  mysql.exe (both the Oracle and MariaDB client) makes this WORSE than it
#  looks: by default it buffers the entire result set INSIDE the client
#  process (mysql_store_result semantics) before it prints anything at all -
#  so reading its stdout incrementally, by itself, does NOT bound memory; the
#  full buffering already happened before a single line reaches us. The
#  --quick flag switches the client to unbuffered/streaming mode
#  (mysql_use_result semantics: fetch-and-print one row at a time as the
#  server sends it), which is what actually makes incremental reading here
#  meaningful. Every cursor-path invocation below passes --quick for exactly
#  this reason - Run-Query2/Run-Query2Bulk deliberately do NOT, since their
#  callers already assume a fully-materialized in-memory result.
#
#  Because every query still shells out to a fresh mysql.exe process (there is
#  no persistent DB connection object to hold a server-side cursor on, unlike
#  a real DB driver), the "cursor" here IS the live mysql.exe process plus an
#  open StreamReader over its stdout: Open-QueryCursor starts it and reads
#  just the first page; Api-FetchCursorBatch reads more pages from the SAME
#  still-running process on a later request (possibly handled by a different
#  pooled runspace, which is why the registry is a ConcurrentDictionary shared
#  via $iss.Variables exactly like $script:RunningQueries already is). The
#  process is registered under the caller's RequestId in $script:RunningQueries
#  using the EXISTING Api-CancelQuery kill path - no second cancel mechanism -
#  and that registration is intentionally NOT cleared just because the first
#  page returned; only whichever event eventually finishes the cursor
#  (exhaustion, an explicit /api/close-cursor, the idle sweep in the main
#  server loop, or a Cancel-triggered kill) clears it, via Close-QueryCursorProc.
# ============================================================================

# A table grid's query also asks for every text column of its table as hex, in columns named
# __nobs_exact_0, _1, ... after the ones shown, wherever the value holds a NUL - which XML output
# turns into a space (see exactTextQuery in the UI). $ExactText names those text columns in order.

# or err when the result does not end in exactly those columns.

# Endpoint: import one or more .sql dump files.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Restoring a dump into a database of your choosing
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A dump made per database - the export dialog's default - opens with its own
#
#   /*!40000 DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS `shop`*/;
#   CREATE DATABASE /*!32312 IF NOT EXISTS*/ `shop` ...;
#   USE `shop`;
#
# and "Target database" was only handed to mysql.exe as its default database, which the file's own
# USE overrides on line three. So "import shop.sql into shop_copy" dropped and rebuilt `shop`
# itself and left `shop_copy` empty - and when the file then failed partway (MySQL rejecting a
# generated column's value, measured on 8.0.46), `shop` was left with the tables up to that point
# and nothing after them.
#
# When a target is chosen those statements now name the target instead. Only whole statements of
# those three kinds at the start of a line are touched, and only their database identifier; data
# rows never start a line with them, because mysqldump escapes newlines inside values. A file that
# names more than one database is refused rather than squashed into one.
#
# Byte-level and streaming: a dump can be many GB, may hold bytes that are not UTF-8, and a
# PowerShell loop per line would take minutes. Compiled once per process; C# 5 so Windows
# PowerShell 5.1 can build it too. The same logic lives in the Tauri edition (dump_db_ident).

// --xml is the only output mode of the command-line client that tells NULL apart from the text
// 'NULL': --batch prints both as NULL, and no option changes that. So a 'NULL' string copied or
// compared through this app became a real NULL. In XML a NULL is <field xsi:nil="true" />.
//
// What XML costs, and how each is dealt with:
//  - the client writes a NUL byte as a space. --binary-as-hex writes binary and BIT columns as
//    0x.. instead, so only a NUL inside a text column is lost (it reads as a space).
//  - MySQL's own client on Windows writes every LF as CRLF, value bytes included. It does so for
//    the XML declaration as well, which is how it is detected and undone here.
//  - a result with no rows carries no column names; the caller asks for those separately.
//  - several statements give several result sets; only the first is returned, and the rest is
//    read and dropped so the process never blocks on a full pipe.

# inserts that SAME chunk into target immediately, chunk by chunk, so the full amount of data
# moved is not limited by what's practical to render as a checkbox list. Still insert-only.
#
# Deliberately not wrapped in one big transaction across every chunk: each chunk's INSERT is
# already its own mysql.exe invocation/statement, which MySQL/InnoDB only ever applies
# all-or-nothing - a chunk failing partway through can't leave that chunk half-inserted. What
# continue-on-error across chunks buys here is that ONE bad chunk (say, a duplicate key from a
# row someone else inserted since the scan started) doesn't abort inserting the rest of what
# could be tens of thousands of otherwise-good rows - unlike Api-CompareRowsApplyDiff above, this

     - schemas + objects sidebar
     - query tabs .. editor with syntax highlight + autocomplete
     - results grid  sortable, filterable, editable, resizable columns
     - overview .... per-database summary + size caching
     - library ..... saved queries (stored on the server)
