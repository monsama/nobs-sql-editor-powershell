# Tests for Get-PluginDir / Friendly-AuthErr - finding the client's authentication plugins.
#
# MySQL 8 authenticates every account with caching_sha2_password by default, including root. That
# is a CLIENT-side plugin: a separate DLL the client loads at connect time, looked for relative to
# the client's own location (../lib/plugin) unless it is told otherwise.
#
# Api-DownloadTools unpacked the .exe files into a flat directory and nothing else, so there was no
# lib/plugin anywhere near them and every connection to a stock MySQL 8 server failed before it got
# as far as negotiating SSL:
#
#   ERROR 1045 (28000): Plugin caching_sha2_password could not be loaded:
#   The specified module could not be found. Library path is 'caching_sha2_password.dll'
#
# Reproduced against a real MySQL 8.0.46 server, and fixed by unpacking the plugins - which ship in
# the same archive - into plugin/ beside the binaries and pointing the client at it.
#
